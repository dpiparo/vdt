V0.3.6
o Fixed suppport for Clang on Mac
o Simpler compiler detection system

V0.3.5
o Added support for Clang in CMake

V0.3.4
o Added regex support to perfbenchmark to profile only groups of functions 
o Removed fpe rising in atan2, both single and double precision, when x 
argument was 0.

V0.3.3
o Minor Bugfixes

V0.3.2
o Added the possibility to prepare the lib for preload. The CMake command
is -DPRELOAD=1. If set, symbols identical to the Libm ones but containing 
a vdt call will be generated in the lib. If preloaded, vdt calls will be 
performed instead of libm ones.

V0.3.1
o Use NEON instructions on ARM (-DNEON=1 cmake option)

V0.3.0
o Constants
 * Add ULL to unsigned long long constants
o CMake
 * Removed -pedantic
 * Add possibility to disable SSE for ARM or other archs
 * More readable constructs
o Can now add debugging symbols to build with -D DEBUG=1 .
o randomPool:
 * Removed long doubles
 * Size is now a uint64_t
 * Refactored: added abstract interface to random generator
 * Added 2D random generator and test 
o Removed redundancy of includes in diagnostic files
o Removed fake program deleteme.cpp
o fcnResponse,fcnComparison:
 * Added interface
 * Added 2D version
 * Added test
o printFuncDiff: added T(T,T) and void(uint32_t,T*,T*,T*) versions
o Atan2:
 * Added tests for response.
 * Integrated in the accuracy tests
 * Double and Single precision
 
 
V0.2.3
o Fixed the installation of atan2.h

v0.2.2
o Removed typos in the documentation (thanks to A. Neumann for spotting this!)
o Fixed CMake to make the install working also on OSx

v0.2.1
o Shared library built by default instead of static one.
o make install now supported. To specify the install dir use the variable -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX= whith cmake.
o Vector signatures are now void (const unsigned int, T const *, T*)
o Petulant compilation flags (picky with warnings)
